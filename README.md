# React + Redux Architecture

The purpose of this article is to introduce the different tools and testing strategies available in a React and Redux stack.
One of the goals of this article is to develop a simple UI component that is simple, extensible, and useful through its properties interface.
A basic and widely used component within any application is a text field.
This article will start with the presentational model of a text field;
customize the display structure with additional buttons and icons;
implement some behavioral states (e.g. keeping track of what has been typed);
and, finally, populate the component from stored database values.
